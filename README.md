NewsFeedr Project fetches and displays current news articles from the NewsAPI service. Users can explore top headlines or search for specific topics. Each article is presented in a visually appealing card format with an image, title, and summary. Clicking on an article opens the full story in a new tab, offering a seamless news browsing experience.
